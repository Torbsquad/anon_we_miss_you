# anon_we_miss_you
 anon has been murdered and we are now attempting to reconstruct his soul
 
 i wish anon were not kill

  
 code starts at main.js
 and requires process.env.anon to be a discord-bot-token (better not a client-user, just to be safe ..)

*its just fun and games, no one has been physically murdered - but anon will still be missed :(*
