# anon_we_miss_you
 anon has been murdered and we are now attempting to reconstruct his soul   
 i wish anon were not kill

 **main.js is the starting point** 
### requirements:
 - `process.env.anon` as discord-bot-token
 - `process.env.cleverbot_user`, `process.env.cleverbot_key` as cleverbot.io login

### please rember  
- **.gitignore** contains a list of things that should be ignored by git  
- **package.json**, **package-lock.json** has dependencies  
- **README.md** is this right here   
- and **main.js** + **js/** is actual code  

*its just fun and games, no one is harmed - but anon will still be missed :(*
