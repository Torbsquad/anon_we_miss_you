# anon_we_miss_you
 anon has been murdered by discord and we are now attempting to reconstruct his soul   
 i wish anon were not kill

 **main.js is the starting point** 
### requirements:
 - `process.env.anon` as discord-bot-token

### optional:
 - `process.env.cleverbot_user`, `process.env.cleverbot_key` as cleverbot.io login
 - `process.env.admins` with comma separated discord-user-ids for access for the eval code injection

### please rember  
 - **.gitignore** contains a list of things that should be ignored by git  
 - **package.json**, **package-lock.json** has dependencies like the discord.js library  
 - **Procfile** describes in our case the way the scripts are going to be started (with main.js)  
 - **README.md** is this right here   
 - and **main.js** + **js/** + **commands/** is actual code  

*its just fun and games, no one is harmed - but anon will still be missed :(*
